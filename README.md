# Commute Map
In this project we create a city map based on how long it takes to commute from there to our workplace every morning. See the [Towards Data Science post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-find-an-apartment-with-a-short-commute-4680e10689d9) and the [included Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/guszejnovdavid/Commute_Map/blob/main/Boston_Transit_Map.ipynb) for details.

This project utilizes data obtained from the Google Mapsd API, twhich can be called from _google_maps_dist_mtx_API_call.py_. If you want to do your own project (i.e., different origin/city) you have to get your own API key. Note that Google Maps allows you to do a moderate number of calls for free, so it is possible to do a project like this for free. However, you must be very careful, it is very easy to go over the limit.
